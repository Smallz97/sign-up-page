## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Mobile-first workflow

### Useful resources

- [MDN - Client-Side form validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation#Customized_error_messages) - This helped me in understanding client side form valiation using both built-in and custom form validation methods. And the use of Javascript in controlling the actions and look of native error messages, and implementing a custom error message.
